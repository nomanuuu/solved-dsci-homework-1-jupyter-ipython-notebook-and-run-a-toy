This assignment is to practice how to use Jupyter/IPython notebook and run a toy example (covid19-state-dataset). Please follow the steps below to have the work done on notebook. The generic template (HW1-covid19 state data.ipynb) of this homework is provided on the <strong>i-school(Plus) </strong>(https://istudy.ntut.edu.tw/learn/index.php) platform of school.

Step 1

Use Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/) to load COVID-19 State Data Set

(https://www.kaggle.com/nightranger77/covid19-state-data/data) as the dataframe.

Step 2

Get 20 data items as sample randomly and show them.

Step 3

Show 10 data items which the Deaths are more than 100 as sample randomly.

Step 4

Sort the data by GDP and present the top 20 data items.

Step 5

Show the simple statistical information (mean, std, min, max, quartile1, quartile2, quartile3).

**Use matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) to show 2D images about data.

Step 6

Plot the distribution of two classes: 1. GDP <em>&lt; </em>58000, and 2. GDP â‰¤ 58000 in COVID-19 State Data using different colors and different marker where <em>x</em>-axis is the Pollution and <em>y</em>-axis the Mortality-rate.

Step 7

Show the proportion of three classes below in COVID-19 State Data using pie chart:

<strong>Class 1 </strong>Mortality-rate <em>&lt; </em>0.02

<strong>Class 2 </strong>Mortality-rate between 0.02 and 0.03

<strong>Class 3 </strong>Mortality-rate <em>&gt; </em>0.03
